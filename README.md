## Introduction

Game of Drones is a browser-based game allowing two or more players to compete with each other and prove who is the one most graced by Lady Luck. 

The project was implemented using ReactJS, NodeJS and MongoDB as a programming assessment for UruIT.

## Features

### 1. Rock-Paper-Scissors
Game of Drones is a game implementing the classic "Rock-Paper-Scissors" where each player selects one of the 3 choices and hopes to beat the selection of his/her oponent. The winner is whomever achieves 3 victories first.
### 2. Multiple players
In this game, unlike most implementations, we don't discreminate for having several friends. It is our strong belief that luck is an important factor in life so being able to win despite very low odds is a great achievement. That said, we are proud to announce that you can play Game of Drones with as many players as you like! The default amount being 2 players.
### 3. Round history
During the rounds, the players will be shown the results of all previous rounds. That is, whether it ended as a draw or if someone won it.
